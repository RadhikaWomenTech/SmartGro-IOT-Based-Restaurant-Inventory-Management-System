🌟 Proud to Share My Latest Project: SmartGro – An IoT-Based Inventory Management System for Restaurants! 🌟

As part of my academic journey, I worked with my amazing teammates, Aditya Bhoj and Sai Bhavana Marada, to develop SmartGro—a solution designed to tackle major challenges in restaurant inventory management.

🔍 Project Overview:
SmartGro uses IoT technology and edge computing to address key issues like food waste, inefficient stock tracking, and manual menu adjustments. Our system is data-driven, cost-effective, and tailored to optimize restaurant operations.

✨ Features at a Glance:
🔹 Real-Time Monitoring: IoT sensors track inventory conditions (stock levels, temperature, humidity) 24/7.
🔹 Smart Alerts: Automated notifications for items nearing expiry or requiring immediate attention.
🔹 Dynamic Menu Suggestions: Intelligent recommendations to minimize waste and maximize ingredient usage.
🔹 Seamless Integration: Compatible with restaurant management platforms for streamlined operations.

🌍 Why It Matters:
The restaurant industry is burdened with inventory management challenges, leading to wasted food, higher costs, and inefficiency. SmartGro provides a scalable and sustainable solution, making operations smarter and more environmentally friendly.
